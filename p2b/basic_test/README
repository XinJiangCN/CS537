To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the base directory of your xv6 code
2. From that directory, execute the runtests executable in this directory
  Like:  ~cs537-2/ta/tests/2b-new/runtests
3. The individual tests are available in the ctests/ folder. You can copy the file you want into your user program and run it locally as you wish.
The output from runtests will indicate which tests you have passed and which you failed (if any)

For more options available while testing, run '.../runtests -h'
